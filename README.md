# vehicle-parking-app
Parking Lot Reservation System is a simple web application built using Flask, SQLite, and Chart.js. It allows users to reserve parking spots in different lots, track their total parking time, and view a summary of their usage. Admin users can view revenue generated from each lot and monitor the number of available and occupied spots in real-time using interactive charts.

To run the project:

Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

Run app.py using Python.

Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the application.

The database file is located in the instance folder. Admin and user roles are handled through the users table. Charts are generated using Chart.js via CDN links in the HTML templates.

This app was built as a practical project for learning Flask-based web application development with real-time database updates and dynamic data visualization.
